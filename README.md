# Go Projects

## Some Point to Keep In Mind

- Always check the branch you are working on
- Also always make sure that your branch is up to date with your parent branch

## Steps to Commit/Checkin the Code

- First add the files to staging that you want to commit
- Make sure you don't add files that are not intended to commit
- Now once files are in staging you can now commit the same using an appropriate commit message
- After commit make sure you push those changes

## Commit using command line

- Add the untarcked file to tracking (if any) usinf command `git add filename`
- Now your file is in staging
- Now you can commit your file using command `git commit -m "Message"`
- Now you could have also done the above 2 steps in single command using `git commit -am "Message"` but avoid this to avoid unnecessary checkins
- Now you have to push those commit as well using command `git push`
